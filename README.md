# P1xt Guides - Version 5.0

Before you start, please let me introduce a bit of my philosophy for learning how to be a top-notch programmer. 

- always be learning 
- always be practicing
- always help others when you can 
- include learning some math

Programming, software engineering, web development, whatever you want to call it, however, you want to approach it, has one immutable characteristic - it's a field in flux, and there are new advances every day - don't let this discourage you, but do let it instill in you an excitement for **learning**. Learning new technologies should be an exciting opportunity for growth, not a disappointing drudgery. Start, from day one, with a celebratory mindset about learning new things - that mindset will skyrocket your progress.

You’ll learn a lot from taking courses. You’ll learn a lot from watching videos. You’ll learn a lot from “reading the docs.” All of these are important, in fact crucial, on your path. If you want to retain all that great learning, you need to **practice** it. Practice will transform something you've been exposed to into something you can “reliably do.” Lean heavily into practicing.

You're learning, you're practicing - do you want to excel? Yes? Then find opportunities to **help others** learn. There is no other activity that will prepare you better to interview well than consistently helping others. It teaches you to interact well with others and communicate technical concepts.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can find a billion people on the internet who will tell you you don't need **math** to be a good programmer. I agree, to a certain extent. That said, math is about learning to solve increasingly complex problems. And, knowing how to logically go about solving increasingly complex problems is what programming is all about. Don't sleep on math, every little extra bit you learn will make you that much better at problem-solving. Yeah, you “can do fine” without the math, but with it, you fly!

**Helpful (non-programming) resources**
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so) - for taking notes (in markdown which will help you write README's later)
- [Finch](https://finchcare.com/) - take care of yourself while communing with a sweet little birb

**General advice**
- If you can't summon the willpower to do anything, decide "I'll do five minutes, that's enough for today." And, then, do 5 minutes. 5 minutes is more than 0 minutes and sometimes leads to ... more minutes ... or not, be ok with either.
- Get enough sleep, everything is better if you've slept well.
- Eat well. If your body and mind have the nutrients they need, they can do their jobs better.
- Get some physical activity. You don't have to run a marathon (unless you're into that) but being physically active helps your body and your mind. Even if it's just a leisurely walk a time or two a day - be active. This will legit help you learn more.
- As soon as you know one thing, help anyone struggling with that one thing. Add to the list of things you help others with as you learn more things. You aren't just helping others, you are helping yourself. You are learning "the thing" more deeply and you are practicing communicationg about technical things. This is a skill you want to be practicing your entire journey, not trying to figure out the day before an interview.
- Always have a practice project you're working on and something your reading. This gives you productive stuff to do if you need a break from what you're learning.
- Finish what you start, even if it's difficult. You'll learn perserverance (extremely valuable), develop confidence, and minimize the risk of getting stuck in a never-ending loop of just repeating beginner stuff while never really being able to do anything amazing.
- You are not special because you know more than someone else. Treat others with dignity and respect. Be humble. No matter how much you've learned, you don't know everything. Lead with kindness, it'll serve you well.
- If you're wondering what all the "Status" and "Evidence" columns are below, they're so that if you fork this repository, you can show when you begin and finish each item (in your fork) and link any projects you did in "Evidence" as a sort of journal for yourself so you can browse back over your journey (and possibly find projects for your eventual portfolio faster)
- If you want practice with git, and don't have a project in mind, take your notes in markdown and save the `.md` files in a github (or gitlab) repository of your notes. You'll get practice with git and get practice with markdown. It's a twofer.

## Tier 4 - Develop a Portfolio

### Goal
The goal of Tier 4 is to polish a portfolio of your best work.

### Instructions:
- Create an online portfolio of your best work. You can:
  - Polish projects you've completed previously
  - Complete new projects
- Ensure the portfolio is visible online
- Ensure that you've adhered to good coding practices
- Ensure that your projects are clean and free from errors
- Aim for between 5 and 10 projects and ensure at least two projects are substantial in size and scope
- If you need project ideas, ask ChatGPT using very specific prompts for project ideas of the scope you need and using the skills and technologies you'd like to highlight

## Tier 5 - Dive Deeper

### Goal
The goal of Tier 5 is to enhance your knowledge and abilities by deep diving into areas of particular interest to you. Select one or more focus areas as your interests dictate.

**Select any area that interests you for further study:**

### Tier 5 - Focus Area - React

You will notice that the resources listed here for React are not courses,YouTube playlists, or podcasts where other people teach you React. This section lists the official docs. This is because:
- by this point you should be capable of, and consistently, "reading the docs"
- React changes pretty regularly, tutorials won't be updated, the docs will.
- The docs are actually fantastic and you will learn far more by diving in, as any course or tutorial would only show you bits and pieces, and to be an expert, you need a much bigger picture.

#### Instructions:
- Thoroughly study each resource. Dive deep into the APIs and documentation after working through any tutorials and quickstarts.
- Always be practicing. Ideas for practice:
  - Projects on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges?sort=difficulty%7Casc&type=free) in React
  - Math progression on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math)
  - [Ask ChatGPT to assign you a programming challenge](./RequestingChallengesFromAI.md)

### Tier 5 - Focus Area - Mathematics

Note: For this Focus Area, feel free to dive into it in its entirety, or just do a course or two here and there to supplement one of the other focus areas. You will notice that if you start working through the Computer Science Focus Area, from time to time, one of the Mathematics courses from this Focus Area will be listed as a pre-requisite.
| Courses                                                                                                                               | Status | Evidence |

### Tier 5 - Focus Area - Computer Science

Note: This focus area dives a bit deeper into nitty-gritty computer science topics. Feel free to jump around and take whichever courses sound most interesting to you. (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs is one of my favorites.) You will, at times, find that a course has a mathematics course pre-requisite - those courses may be found in the Mathematics Focus Area above.
